# quattroshapes

_The Global Polygon Gazetteer_

[Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) needs quality place data to power its geocoding engine to ensure the best recommendations. When someone searches for the best coffee in Brooklyn, a simple venue to place point or venue to place bounding box search can result in venues in Manhattan and Jersey City overwhelming the results for Brooklyn. 

To improve recommendations, we have created an authoritative source of polygons around a curated list of places. This gazetteer of non-overlapping polygons provides more relevant results than simple point geometries.

This work is based on foursquare checkins, geo tagged photos from [Flickr](http://flickr.com), an extended version of [Natural Earth](http://naturalearthdata.com), and [open government data](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/opendata). Concordance is provided between quattroshapes, [geonames.org](http://geonames.org), and [Yahoo! GeoPlanet](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/) unique IDs in the gazetteer.

The quattroshapes technique calculates the dominant place ID for a given area based on heterogeneous inputs. This work is an extension of [alphashapes](http://code.flickr.net/2008/10/30/the-shape-of-alpha/) and [betashapes](https://github.com/simplegeo/betashapes) (thanks [Aaron](https://github.com/straup) and [Schuyler](https://github.com/schuyler)!) and is used to backfill countries without complete open data.

Matching mapping agency polygons to the geonames.org dataset was performed using [shape-gn-matchr](https://github.com/blackmad/shputils). Concording geoplanet to geonames lives at [geoplanet-concordance](https://github.com/blackmad/geoplanet-concordance).

Geocoding can be the hardest part about going open source - and reverse geocoding is even harder. Reverse geocoding reports the gazetteer place for a latitude and longitude map location or address string and is useful when source data needs to be normalized. This new polygon gazetteer data is used in [Twofishes](https://github.com/foursquare/twofishes) ([demo](http://twofishes.net)), the coarse splitting geocoder (and reverse geocoder) written in scala from [David Blackman](https://github.com/blackmad/) at foursquare.
